         Hi, I'm Kentravious, a Frontend Developer and 3D artist with customer relations experience based in Georgia. With 2 years of experience in the web design industry, I am passionate about creating engaging and intuitive user experiences that satisfy customers.

As a Frontend Developer, I specialize in coding on the client side, and have a proven track record of delivering high-quality designs that meet business objectives. I am skilled in HTML5, SCSS, REACT.js, THREE.JS, Blender, and design tools like Figma while always exploring new technologies and trends to stay at the forefront of my field.

In addition to my Frontend work, I also have experience in customer relations, having worked. In these roles, I developed strong communication and problem-solving skills, and learned how to build lasting relationships with customers.

As a 3D artist, I am passionate about bringing ideas to life in a visual and immersive way. I specialize in 3D Modeling and lighting, and have created quite a few projects that you can withness for yourself here.

I have embraced this path through completing the Scrimba Frontend Developer path, introduction to cloud development, Three.js Journey Bruno Simon to constantly improve my craft. In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with trees, catching up on anime while I find the perfect chip to sandwich ratio.
