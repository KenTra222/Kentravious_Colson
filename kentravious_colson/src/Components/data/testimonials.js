He was very patient with me even whin I couldn't send any work or comments for a few days, patient with me even when i'd gotten sick. He helped explain things to me and made sure to answer any uncertainties I'd had. Even though I decided to go a different way for my project, if I'd ever go to anyone again it would for sure be him. I always recommend him when anyone asks about making a website but I always make them aware of the terrible dad jokes."
